TowerOfHanioProject
===================

Every one knows the tower of hanoi and this is a implementation of that using java

This project has three project's all based on the tower of hanoi.

The first one is Hanoi.java which asks the user to enter the number of disks in the game and then gives out all the moves 
that can be made to bring all the disks to the third peg.

The second is the TowerGame.java which asks the user to enter the number of disks and then it displays a digital
representation of the game and the asks the user to enter the number from where the disk is to be removed the then asks
where to place the disk, if the move is leagal then it moves it and the game ends when all the disks are on the peg 3.

And the third is HanoiHintGame.java which is also the same as the second but if the user is struck and does't know what
to do next then he can ask the computer to help him by giving the next move by pressing 0.
